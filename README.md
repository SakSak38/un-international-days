# United Nations International Days
145 International Days are observed by the United Nations according to their [website](http://www.un.org/en/sections/observances/international-days/)
This project will provide the complete set in a format which can be imported into generic calendar applications.

# Usage
You can directly import the calendar file from Github by using the URL for the ics-file (raw version):
[webcal://github.com/civilianEU/un-international-days/raw/master/un-international-days.ics](webcal://github.com/civilianEU/un-international-days/raw/master/un-international-days.ics)

# Contributing
Feel free to create a pull request to include additional details or missing International Days.

Pull requests should pass a [validator test](https://icalendar.org/validator.html) without warnings or errors and should only include events / information found in authorative UN sources. Please include references if a source other than the [UN overview of International Days](http://www.un.org/en/sections/observances/international-days/) is used.

It would be especially good to have a description including a reference to the respective resolutions.
